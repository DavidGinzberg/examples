# Programming Examples

## Purpose of this repository

This is a colleciton of code examples used to demonstrate different concepts and syntactical structures in a variety of programming languages.
All of the included examples should be runnable on their own as they are configured in the repository. Some of the examples may
require you to install the appropriate languages' compilers or interpreters before you are able to run them. In the future there may also be
a way to run the code samples online, on sites such as [mybinder](mybinder.org) or [CodePen](codepen.io).
